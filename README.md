# QUIZ  GAME  about  ESTONIA

## Welcome to my very first game!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program (5P) Portfolio Project Two. It will be a quiz website aimed at the people who would be interested in Estonia or people, who never even heard about Estonia and are interested in a short game.

You can check out the website [here!](https://helej.github.io/quiz-game-about-Estonia)

## Project Description
This site was created  to get more familiar with common development tools like Gitpod, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The website content will be created with HTML, the website will be styled with the use of CSS, and its functionality will come from the implementation of JavaScript.The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program.

## Technology
This project was written in HTML, CSS & JavaScript using GitHub.

##  Introduction

As an Estonian living abroad already for many years, I'm used to seeing confused faces when I'm telling I'm Estonian.  Most people don't have the slightest clue where Estonia can even be? Is that a small country even in Europe? 
For my second project, I thought I will be an ambassador. I created a short quiz game about a small country, far far away. Country what is bigger than Denmark or Switzerland but population only 1,3 million and decreasing.

* After entering a game and reading rules you can start a game.

* There is a total of 5 five questions and 4 four options answers. After you selected an option, if this option is correct then there appears a green tick icon, and if wrong then you see a red cross. By selecting the wrong answer, you will be shown the right answer. 

* In the end, is a result box with a score and replay & quit button.

* The quiz is created to inspire, and add curiosity about Estonia.

I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good on functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

* Browser Validation

I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome and Internet Explorer

2. Automated testing
* Code validation
* Lighthouse auditing

## Content

### Code

* The code to make my second project was taken from Youtube 
* I part:["Create a Quiz App with Timer using HTML CSS & JavaScript"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQr4O1OITJo&t=1324s) 
* II part from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk&t=5s)

The first video instructing how to build up content using HTML and CSS, and the video was a JavaScript tutorial. Codes from both videos have been edited to fit the needs of the Quiz about the Estonia website. I wish I could have written all of the JavaScript code independently, however, I felt that using some pre-made code that already did (almost) what I needed it to, would improve the standard of code, decrease the chance of potential bugs and allow me to work within the timeframe to meet the deadline for the project. I was able to edit and add things to the code as and when I needed to be able to make the web-quiz interactivity how I had imagined it during the planning phase.

### Questions and answers in the web quiz were found and worded by myself

* Material for question 2 [Kiiking](https://kiikest.ee/eng/kiiking/)

* Material for question 3 [Skype](https://content.dsp.co.uk/history-of-skype)

* Material for question 5 [E-residency](https://e-resident.gov.ee/)


## Media

* The background image used throughout the website, and used for different screen sizes  was taken from [here](https://pildiait.erm.ee/lipuvarvid-varahommikul/)
