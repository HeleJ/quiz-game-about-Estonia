# QUIZ  GAME  about  ESTONIA

## Welcome to my very first game!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program (5P) Portfolio Project Two. It will be a quiz website aimed at the people who would be interested about Estonia or people, who never even heard about Estonia and interested about short game.

## Project Description
This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Gitpod, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code.The website content will be created with HTML, the website will be styled with the use of CSS, and it's functionality will come from the implementation of JavaScript.The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program.

# Credits

## Content

* The code to make my second project was taken from Youtube 
* I part:["Create a Quiz App with Timer using HTML CSS & JavaScript"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQr4O1OITJo&t=1324s) 
* II part from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk&t=5s)

The first video instructing how to build up contennt using HTML and CSS, and the  video was JavaScript tutorial. Codes from both videos have been edited to fit the needs of the Quiz about Estonia website. I wish I could have written all of the JavaScript code independently, however I felt that using some pre-made code that already did (almost) what I needed it to, would improve the standard of code, decrease the chance of potential bugs and allow me to work within the timeframe to meet the deadline for the project. I was able to edit and add things to the code as and when I needed to be able to make the web-quiz interactivity how I had imagined it during the planning phase.

 Questions and answers in the web-quiz were found and worded by myself

* Material for question 2 [Kiiking](https://kiikest.ee/eng/kiiking/)

* Material for question 3 [Skype](https://content.dsp.co.uk/history-of-skype)

* Material for question 5 [E-residency](https://e-resident.gov.ee/)


## Media

* The background image used throughout the website, and used for different screen sizes  was taken from [here](https://pildiait.erm.ee/lipuvarvid-varahommikul/)
